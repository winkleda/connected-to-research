        <FundingOppDescription>The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), operating through the Risk Management Agency (RMA), announces the availability of approximately $500,000 (subject to availability of funds) for Commodity Partnerships for Small Agricultural Risk Management Education Sessions (Commodity Partnerships Small Sessions Program). The purpose of this cooperative partnership agreement program is to deliver training and information in the management of production, marketing, and financial risk to U.S. agricultural producers in small sessions. The program is to give priority to educating producers of crops not insurable with Federal crop insurance, specialty crops, and underserved commodities, including livestock and forage. A maximum of 50 cooperative partnership agreements will be funded, five each in ten designated RMA Regions. The maximum award for any agreement will be $10,000. Recipients of awards must demonstrate nonfinancial benefits from a partnership agreement and must agree to the substantial involvement of RMA in the project. Funding availability for this program may be announced at approximately the same time as funding availability for similar but separate programs. CFDA No. 10.455 (Community Outreach and Assistance Partnerships), CFDA No. 10.456 (Risk Management Research Partnerships),  CFDA No. 10.457 (Commodity Partnerships for Risk Management Education) and CFDA No.10.458 (Crop Insurance Education in Targeted States).

        <FundingOppDescription>Grants for Fellowship Programs at Independent Research Institutions (FPIRI) support fellowships at institutions devoted to advanced study and research in the humanities. NEH fellowships provide scholars with research time and access to resources that might not be available at their home institutions. Fellowship programs may be administered by independent centers for advanced study, libraries, and museums in the United States; American overseas research centers; or organizations that have expertise in promoting research on foreign cultures. Individual scholars must apply directly to the institutions themselves. A list of currently funded institutions is available. In evaluating applications from programs at institutions located in the United States, priority is given to those with library holdings, archives, or other special collectionseither on-site or nearbythat are available as resources for NEH fellows. American overseas research centers should demonstrate a particular benefit to NEH fellows by virtue of their location and other resources. FPIRI gramts provide funding to programs for humanities fellowships of four to twelve months. Fellowship tenure must be continuous.   FPIRI grants support fellowship stipends and standard allowances, as well as a portion of the costs for both publicizing the availability of the fellowships and selecting the fellows. The stipends and allowances for NEH fellows are determined in accordance with an institution's usual practices. However, the maximum amount of NEH funding is $50,400 for a six- to twelve-month fellowship and $25,200 for a four- to five-month fellowship. A grantee institution may supplement the stipends of NEH fellows from its own funds, and fellows may receive additional funds from other sources. NEH fellows must be granted the same benefits, services, and accommodations normally accorded other fellows.</FundingOppDescription>
